This Maze Solver is an efficient and user-friendly application that tackles the challenge 
of finding the shortest path through complex mazes. Utilizing a blend of Java and C++, 
it implements the three most popular graph search algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), 
and A* Search, demonstrating their applications and effectiveness in pathfinding contexts.
