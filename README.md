# Maze Solver

This Maze Solver is an efficient and user-friendly application that tackles the challenge 
of finding the shortest path through complex mazes. Utilizing a blend of Java and C++, 
it implements the three most popular graph search algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), 
and A* Search, demonstrating their applications and effectiveness in pathfinding contexts.

## Getting Started

To experience the Maze Solver, please follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Java and G++ installed on your system to compile and run the application.

### Project Launch

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

``` git clone "https://github.com/AlambekG/mazeSolver.git" ```

2. In the repository folder, run:

``` make ```

3. Launch the Java application:

``` java -Xss4m -jar MazeGame.jar ```


After launching, you will be presented with a graphical interface showcasing the maze and options to solve it.
